## Context
The `types` folder stores TypeScript type definitions for type safety.

## Requirements
- Include global types in `types/global.ts`.
- Define interfaces for props, state, and reusable data structures.
- Ensure type definitions are consistent, well-documented, and exported.
- Update types as the application evolves to maintain type safety.

## Examples
- Correct:
  ```typescript
  // types/global.ts
  export interface User {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    name: string;
  }
  ```

- Incorrect:
  ```typescript
  // types/global.ts
  type User = any; // Avoid using any
  ```
