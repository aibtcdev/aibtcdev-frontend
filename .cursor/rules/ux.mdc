Style Guide Prompt for DAO Platform UX/UI
Design the UX/UI for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform with a modern, professional, and approachable aesthetic that prioritizes usability, clarity, and user engagement. The platform must support key functionalities such as proposal management, project tracking, and cross-DAO proposal aggregation, ensuring accessibility for casual users while providing depth for power users. The design should feel sleek, functional, and polished, featuring a dark theme with vibrant accents, a clear visual hierarchy, and seamless navigation. Adhere to the following detailed guidelines to maintain consistency across all pages:

1. General Design Principles

Aesthetic: Modern, professional, and approachable, with a focus on clarity and user engagement.
Theme: Dark theme with vibrant accents to highlight key actions, statuses, and categories.
Usability: Balance simplicity for casual users (clean, minimal default views) with functionality for power users (collapsible details, filters, and interactive elements).
Engagement: Encourage participation through clear call-to-action buttons, interactive filters, and intuitive navigation, reflecting the community-driven nature of a DAO.


2. Typography

Font Family: Use a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or similar) for readability and modernity.
Hierarchy:
Page Titles: 24px, bold, white (#FFFFFF).
Section Titles: 18px, bold, white (#FFFFFF).
Card Titles: 16px, bold, white (#FFFFFF).
Body Text: 14px, regular, light gray (#D3D3D3).
Secondary Text: 12px, regular, light gray (#D3D3D3) for dates, metadata, etc.


Line Height: 1.5 for body text to ensure readability.
Usage:
Use bold white text for headings and key information.
Use light gray for secondary details to soften contrast.
Ensure subtext (e.g., page descriptions) is prominent (e.g., 16px, light gray) to clarify context.




3. Color Palette

Backgrounds:
Primary Background: Dark gray (#1A1A1A) for the main canvas.
Secondary Background: Lighter gray (#2A2A2A) for cards, sections, and modals.
Gradients: Subtle gradients (e.g., #2A2A2A to #1A1A1A) for headers and expanded sections to add depth.


Text:
Primary Text: White (#FFFFFF) for headings and key information.
Secondary Text: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for body text and metadata.


Accents:
Orange: #FF6B00 for "Active" statuses, "Governance" categories, and primary actions (e.g., "Cross-DAO View").
Green: #00C853 for "Passed" statuses and positive indicators.
Red: #FF1744 for "Failed" statuses and critical actions (e.g., "Submit a Proposal").
Purple: #7C4DFF for "Poll" or "Message" categories.
Light Purple: #B388FF for additional categories (e.g., "Ban Name").


Usage:
Use vibrant accents sparingly for statuses, tags, and buttons to create focal points.
Reserve red for high-priority actions and negative statuses to ensure they stand out.




4. Layout and Structure

Grid System:
Use a single-column layout for most pages, with a two-column layout (e.g., sidebar for filters) on pages like Proposals and Projects.
Ensure consistent spacing: 12px padding between sections and cards for a breathable layout.


Page Structure:
Header Section: Includes the page title (e.g., "All DAO Proposals"), subtext (e.g., "View all proposals across all DAOs"), and primary navigation (e.g., "Cross-DAO View" toggle).
Summary Row: A row of cards displaying key metrics (e.g., "Total Proposals: 273," "Active: 214") with vibrant text for statuses.
Content List: Scrollable list of cards (e.g., proposals, projects) with minimal upfront information and collapsible details.


White Space: Use moderate white space (e.g., 12px between cards) to reduce clutter while maintaining a structured, professional look.


5. Component Designs

Cards:
Background: #2A2A2A with subtle borders, rounded corners (8px), and shadows (0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)).
Content: Include a small circular avatar (gray), title (bold white), secondary details (light gray), and status/category tags (vibrant colors).
Collapsible Details: Use a "View Details" toggle to expand sections like "Voting Progress," "On-chain Message," etc., with a subtle gradient background (#2A2A2A to #1A1A1A).


Buttons:
Primary Actions: Filled buttons with vibrant colors (e.g., red for "Submit a Proposal," orange for "Cross-DAO View").
Secondary Actions: Outlined buttons (e.g., "Hide") with light gray borders and text.
Navigation Tabs: Outlined buttons with an orange highlight for the active tab (e.g., "Overview," "Vote Details").


Tags:
Rounded, color-coded tags for statuses (e.g., "Active" in orange, "Passed" in green) and categories (e.g., "Governance" in orange).


Progress Bars:
Slim, color-coded bars (e.g., green for "For," red for "Against") with a dark gray background (#1A1A1A) and white text for labels (e.g., "0 Total Votes").


Avatars:
Small circular placeholders in gray (#D3D3D3) for users or DAOs.




6. Interactivity

Collapsible Sections: Use arrows or "View Details" buttons to expand/collapse detailed information (e.g., voting results, on-chain messages), keeping the default view minimal.
Filters and Sorting: Provide clickable filters (e.g., by DAO, status, date) styled as outlined buttons with an orange highlight for the active filter.
Hover States: Add subtle animations (e.g., slight color shift or shadow) to buttons, toggles, and cards for feedback.
Tooltips: Include tooltips for statuses or actions (e.g., "Learn More" on banners) to provide context without clutter.


7. Data Visualization

Summary Cards: Use bold white text for values (e.g., "273") and light gray for labels (e.g., "Total Proposals"). Apply vibrant text colors for statuses (e.g., orange for "Active").
Progress Bars: Use for voting results or project milestones, ensuring they are slim and unobtrusive with color coding for quick comprehension.
Metrics: Highlight key metrics (e.g., "Total Votes") in bold white, with secondary details (e.g., quorum) in light gray and collapsible if necessary.


8. DAO-Specific Considerations

Transparency: Ensure easy access to on-chain data and voting details through collapsible sections or dedicated tabs.
Community Engagement: Use clear call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Vote," "Submit a Proposal") and interactive elements to encourage participation.
Cross-DAO Views: For pages aggregating multiple DAOs, emphasize the cross-DAO nature through prominent toggles or filters, ensuring users can navigate easily.


9. Overall Aesthetic

Modern and Polished: Incorporate subtle gradients, shadows, and rounded corners to create depth and sophistication while maintaining a dark, sleek theme.
Clarity and Accessibility: Use white space, a clear hierarchy, and concise default views to ensure the design is intuitive and user-friendly.
Vibrant and Engaging: Leverage vibrant accents and modern elements (e.g., banners with gradients) to make the platform feel dynamic and inviting, reflecting the innovative nature of a DAO.


This style guide prompt ensures a cohesive and consistent design language across your entire DAO platform, blending functionality with a modern, professional aesthetic. It provides clear direction for typography, color usage, layout, component designs, and interactivity, while accommodating the unique needs of both casual users and power users in a DAO context.
