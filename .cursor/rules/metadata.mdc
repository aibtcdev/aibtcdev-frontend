To ensure optimal search engine visibility, every file must include proper SEO configurations. This includes setting viewport properties for responsive design and metadata for search engine optimization.

## How to Implement Good SEO

Include the following configurations in your file to enhance SEO performance:

### Example

```typescript
export const viewport: Viewport = {
  width: "device-width",
  initialScale: 1,
  maximumScale: 1,
  userScalable: false,
};

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "DAOs",
  description: "Bitcoin-backed DAOs. Fully autonomous governance.",
};
```

### Explanation
- **Viewport**: Configures the page to adapt to the device's width, with a fixed scale to prevent unwanted zooming, ensuring a mobile-friendly experience.
- **Metadata**:
  - `title`: A concise, descriptive title (e.g., "DAOs") that reflects the page content and includes relevant keywords.
  - `description`: A brief summary (e.g., "Bitcoin-backed DAOs. Fully autonomous governance.") that captures the essence of the page and entices users to click.

Ensure these configurations are tailored to each file's specific content for maximum SEO effectiveness.
